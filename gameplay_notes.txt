Control Structure
-----------------

[] Remove AP check from Combatant

Resources
Steps + Turns + AP
	* Every Combatant has Action Points consumed by skills.  Turn ends when all Combatants on the board have used or banked their AP.  AP is replenished with next turn.

Controlling Squad
	* AI Free Control
		* Party members have their own Planner and choose their own Goals.
		* Goals are weighted by their personality and relationship values
	* Goal chosen
		* Player puts a heavy weight on a particular goal
		* The scale of that weight affected by social stats. Party member can choose to ignore.
	* Direct Control
		* Player has complete control over squad, but requires micromanagement in the general case. Encourage using this in tense combat situations.

	What does this add?
		* A sense of progression in the player's relationship with other characters.
		* The player is a distinct entity from the other characters
	Challenges?
		* The Friendly AI could get you killed. Is this fine?
		* Need a means of anticipating enemy movement

XCOM creates a space for the player to create soldier personalities in the dice rolls, plus the situations.
Are you in danger of sinking too much time into trying to make this explicit in systems? 

Direct Control Methods
1. XCOM style. Player issues commands to all characters at beginning of turn. While assigning commands to a character, 'ghosts' of the other characters commands show the anticipated state after each action. Player hits an 'Engage' button to carry out actions.
	+  Uniform structure for every character
	++ Requires anticipation from player
	-- Lower turn granularity than Formation mode. Formation mode might be even more viable, making engagements all really awkward.

2. Rogueish.  Player assigns commands to party members at beginning of turn.  Controls avatar directly using RL controls, and every action controls the turn progression.
	+ Medium granularity. Player avatar can adapt to new conditions, but party members can't
	++ Gives an advantage to leader character. Opens possibilities to crawls where the avatar isn't the leader.
	- Tedious to assign actions to everyone

============================================
Verdict: Rogueish + AI
============================================

Each party member can be assigned a general Goal:
	* Free Action - whatever they want
	* Attack greatest threat - Prioritize enemies with highest danger index
	* Attack least threat - Prioritize enemies with lowest danger index
	* Retreat and Conserve - Prioritize avoiding damage while not using Skills with long cooldowns or one-use items
	* Survive - Prioritize survival at all costs
	* Direct Control
