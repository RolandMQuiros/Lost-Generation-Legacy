Architecture Notes
------------------
* Separate Skills from their Combatants?
	* Constructing the GOAP Skill Graph is O(n^2), naively. Best if we only have one instance of the graph per enemy type?
* Should probably separate Skills from SkillNodes
	* Skills should contain the logic to create certain actions, but don't have a specific outcome
	* The Decision class
		* The same as "Action" in all the tutorials, but that name's already taken here.
		* Uses Skills to generate an outcome (Postcondition / Goal). This is what contains all the GraphNode stuff.
