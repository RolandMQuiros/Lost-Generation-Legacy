You just graduated from adventurer's school, and now you have to pay off your student loans.  Luckily, you're not alone.

# Lost-Generation

Lost Generation is a roguelite dungeon crawler without permadeath, but you can still lose everything, except the friends you made along the way.

- Build a community of fellow impoverished adventurers with characters with dynamic personalities, schedules, and goals

- Plumb the procredurally-generated dungeon depths with up to five party members

- Fight the unforgiving hordes in a unique, simultaneously-resolving tactical combat system

# Current Progress

The game is very much a work-in-progress. Features I currently have implemented are:

- A block mesh renderer with auto-tiled textures

- A [Goal-Oriented Action Planning implementation](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html), modified to include some small optimizations inspired by [Hierarchical Task Networks](http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro/GameAIPro_Chapter12_Exploring_HTN_Planners_through_Example.pdf).

- An implementation of [Djikstra Maps](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=The_Incredible_Power_of_Dijkstra_Maps) used to inform the actions from the above planner

- A component-based roguelike architecture, built to be independent from Unity

- A rudimentary in-game blend shape editor for character customization

- A partial implementation of the aforementioned combat system
